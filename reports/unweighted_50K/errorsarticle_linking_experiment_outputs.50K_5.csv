false_alarm,WOS:000449830300011,2018,on the question of identity in a post apartheid world co creation as an alternative to ontorace logy,how does one understand who one is in a post apartheid world put differently what comes after the logic of apartheid in this article i take up the question by arguing for a notion of identity as action rather than essence that is a notion of identity that allows for one s existence in the world as always with others in order to argue the case the first part of the article hermeneutically analyses the logic that constitutes the colonial and apartheid conceptions of identity as onto race logy that is a logic taken over from a certain form of western metaphysical thinking that takes race as its highest and grounding principle according to which the totality is ordered according to this logic identity functions as something which is the same as itself a a it is an essentialised form of identity that is separate from the world as totality in a vacuum like existence the world and the other are therefore understood according to the categories of the self in which the self or its identity is given an elevated position in relation to the world and others that is a certain racial identity in the case of onto race logy furthermore the logic has two ethical implications firstly binary oppositions are set up the identity of the other becoming the negative pole of the positive self identity for instance the colonised african subject is seen as negative and primitive in relation to the western subject in apartheid terms the black man is regarded as godless and the opposite of the christian white man and branded as a kaffir the latter term originates from the arabic word kafir meaning infidel and may be compared to the use of negro in america and negre in the french speaking world both fulfilling the same function difference or strangeness is typified negatively and should therefore be kept apart in addition this negative typification occurs through the process of scapegoating which has a long history in the western world in which all the sins aggression guilt and violence of the group are projected onto the stranger this is a means of creating a binding identity and solidarity within a group moreover the negative typification and scapegoating is accompanied by the creation of myths that are not based in reality but in fantasy in this instance myths about the black man who is seen as exotic barbaric hyper sexual pre political and so forth these myths create a mask of race that covers the face of the other and provides the content with which to typify the second ethical implication is that the other is not only typified as negative but is also regarded as less valuable ontologically hence enclosed in the term kaffir is the misrecognition of the human dignity of the person enclosed by this concept of identity the same logic that holds for the relation between the self and the other is also at play in society and determines the way in which the totality and the relation between groups are structured the meaning within a society is determined by the identity of one group which may lead to a state of totalitarianism apartheid is an example of this function where the world we live in is determined by the categories of race which largely dominate to this day our identity is thus enclosed in and reduced to race the first part ends with an exploration of another reason for the creation and perpetuation of racial identities in the colonial and apartheid eras this reason concerns the creation of racial categories for the justification of the exploitation of people for capitalistic ends in other words if the black man is not regarded as fully human there can be no objection to treating them as inferior and to rationalise any practices that follow from such a conception since all identities are enclosed in this logic the white man is in turn regarded as fully human and therefore economic and political prosperity is justified and because this logic has not yet been overcome white privilege has become part of the everyday discourse in south africa a discourse in which the connection between economic prosperity and the identity of the white man is regarded as negative in the absence of political power more important although these constructions of white man and black man or any other racial construction might not apply to one one is still captured in them and the misrecognition of one s existence in the world may lead to alternative self conceptions the second part of the article explores what might follow on the logic of apartheid or the colony in the larger context namely the onto race logical constructions of identity two choices are outlined the first choice entails a perpetuation of the logic by a nostalgic appeal to the colonial and apartheid conception of identity or by the construction of a new absolute reference point as found in variations of the ideology of pan africanism and afrocentrism this would lead to the totality becoming enclosed in a logic based on an essentialised notion of identity the existence of the other in both cases being misrecognised apartheid itself may be regarded as an example of this choice because it originated in a project of decolonising british colonial oppression and reappropriated the problematic logic in new forms the second choice by contrast aims at breaking with that logic by reconsidering the notion of identity at an ontological level instead of an essentialised notion of identity identity should be considered as accounting for our existence in the world with others hence one does not think about the relation to the other or about self understanding from a point of isolation but rather in relation to the other in our co existence therefore where each person is co original co creation of meaning takes place the implication of this ontological shift is that there is no notion of a pure identity but rather that identities are always intertwined with other identities and that each identity needs an other to be an identity meaning is co created in tension with others moreover as part of our shared existence there is an ethical responsibility in our shared striving for a dignified life and that is the demand of the reparation of the human dignity of all thus to take responsibility for the past and the present is to contemplate our shared existence in the future and to take up the shared responsibility for it which makes it a universal task,['gerber'],pub.1058003629,2012,core contribution to

supersymmetric models that decays into a final state consisting of collimated muons or electrons denoted lepton jets the analysis uses fb of root s tev proton proton collision data recorded by the atlas detector at the large hadron collider to search for the following signatures single lepton jets with at least four muons pairs of lepton jets each with two or more muons and pairs of lepton jets with two or more electrons this study finds no statistically significant deviation from the standard model prediction and places confidence level exclusion limits on the production cross section times

etudes ont montre que l infection par le vih aggravait l histoire naturelle de l infection par le vhc en revanche les etudes qui se sont attachees a apprecier l effet des therapeutiques antiretrovirales sur l histoire naturelle des hepatites chroniques c chez les patients co infectes sont plus discutees dans des cohortes de taille importante il a ete demontre que la mortalite hepatique augmentait avec l exposition aux antiretroviraux cependant la duree du traitement antiretroviral rend aussi compte de la survie plus importante des patients ce qui biaise vraisemblablement les chiffres l effet de l infection par le vhc sur la progression de la maladie a vih est plus discute les patients infectes par le vih doivent beneficier en tous cas de la recherche d une co

dans l infection par le vih en revanche elle peut etre un facteur predictif de reponse au traitement le bilan pretherapeutique comprend aussi une determination du genotype viral car il a ete

to appreciate the effect of the antiretroviral therapeutics on the natural history of the chronic hepatitis c on the co infected patients are more discussed in cohorts of big size it was demonstrated that the hepatic mortality increased with the exposure to antiretrovirals however the duration of the antiretroviral treatment also reports the more important survival of the patients which distorts credibly the figures the effect of the infection by the hcv on the progress of the disease with hiv is more discussed the patients infected by the hiv in any case have to benefit from the research for a co infection by the viruses of hepatitis b and c hbv and hcv this screening must be renewed every year in particular on the drug addicts patients or presenting behaviors at risk viral replicationthe research of a viral replication must be implemented for any confirmed positive hcv serology the research of the hcv rna needs ultrasensitive techniques of molecular biology which allow a qualitative detection and or a quantification of the viral genome viral load the techniques of last generation of real time pcr combine both approaches detection and quantification the viral load hcv is not correlated to the degree of hepatic disease and does not predict the severity of the hepatic disease contrary to the correlation demonstrated in the infection by the hiv on the other hand it can be a predictive factor in the response to the treatment the pretherapeutic check up also includes a determination of the viral genotype because a strong involvement in the response to the treatment was clearly demonstrated hepatic fibrosisthe hepatic fibrosis must be estimated on patients having a chronic hepatitis because it conditions the prognosis and the treatment of the hepatitis the anatomopathological study after hepatic biopsy dhb remains the reference method recently the development of non invasive methods of measure of the hepatic fibrosis improved the care of hepatitis c notably the blood tests fibrotest biopredictive paris fibrometer bls angers and physical measures as the impulsional elastometry fibroscan echosens which substitutes more and more in practice to the draining hepatic biopsy treatmentnumerous studies now validated the treatment associating interferon pegilated and ribavirine as the reference treatment on the co infected patients hiv hcv this treatment involves a high virological response going from to in the patients infected by a genotype and and from to in the patients infected by a genotype or the duration of the treatment is weeks as well as usual virological factors on the mono infected patients genotype viral load the rate of cd is one of the best predictive factors with a good response many hopes go towards the new molecules in development inhibitors of protease inhibitors of polymerase with promising results on the mono infected patients however the toxicity of these molecules is not very well known at the moment in the co infected patients it is thus necessary to perform trials in this group of patient by watching very carefully the toxicity of the therapeutic associations,"['le guillou guillemette', 'cales',

item self report measurement of obsessive compulsive symptoms that measures both classic compulsive checking and cleaning behaviour as well as various types of obsessions including impulses studies in several countries have provided support for the reliability and validity of the padua inventory including italy the netherlands north america and the uk the obsessive beliefs questionnaire assesses belief domains related to obsessive compulsive disorder ocd inflated responsibility importance of thoughts control of thoughts overestimation of threat perfectionism and intolerance of uncertainty it consists of items representing dysfunctional assumptions covering these six domains the interpretation of intrusions inventory consists of items that refer to interpretations of intrusions that have occurred recently three of the above domains are represented importance of thoughts control of thoughts and responsibility data from clinical or non clinical samples are used to study the factor structure reliability and convergent and divergent validity of these two questionnaires methodology the three questionnaires were administrated to two groups of people as follows patients with ocd and non clinical subjects the patients were selected from rhone alpes clinics and hospitals using dsm iv criteria for diagnosis prior to treatment diagnosis was based on semi structured interview mini and clinical interview by a trained psychiatrist using dsm iv criteria the second aim of the study was to investigate generality and congruence criterion of the subscales of the padua inventory and beliefs domains in ocd symptom subtypes rumination washing checking the present study investigates whether specific ocd symptom subtypes are associated with specific symptom subscales and belief domains in an ocd sample the criteria for categorizing a participant into an ocd symptom subtype was a score greater or equal to of one main ritual fifty participants met these criteria washing n rumination n checking n hoarding n perfectionism n and repeating n the other subjects formed a non specific symptom subtype two or more rituals participants in the precision perfectionism the hoarding and repeating symptom subtypes were excluded because of a small sample results the padua inventory and the two questionnaires obq and iii discriminated between french ocd and non clinical controls in the ocd sample the three subtypes washers rumination and checkers did not differ from each other on total ybocs score and total padua score the washer subjects scored higher than both checker subjects and subjects with rumination on the washing scale of the padua inventory the checker subjects scored higher than the two other subtypes on the checking scale the impaired mental control and urges and worries of losing control scales failed to discriminate between the subjects with rumination and the two other checking and washing subtypes the obq total and the six subscale scores failed to

pp and dbp were measured before treatment and at the terminal of a week treatment for subjects in the intervention group left ventricular ejection fraction lvef was also recorded results after a week treatment the sbp in the two groups and the pp in the intervention group decreased significantly compared to those before treatment p after treatment the dbp in the control group decreased p while the dbp and lvef in the intervention group showed an increase tendency although it had no statistical significance p when subjects in the intervention group were classified further by the course of disease the dbp and lvef of subjects whose course of disease were less than years increased significantly after treatment p conclusion western medicine combined with cm treatment based on syndrome differentiation was safer and more effective than western medicine alone in the treatment of elderly phpt because it not only reduced sbp but also improved dbp which might lower the incidence of the
