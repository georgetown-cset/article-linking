## Results

Our current method is extremely simple. Nevertheless, we were able to match the following
percentages of the datasets to each other (self-matches included):

arXiv-arXiv | xxx

arXiv-WOS | xxx

arXiv-DS | xxx

arXiv-MAG | xxx

WOS-WOS | xxx

WOS-DS | xxx

WOS-MAG | xxx

DS-MAG | xxx

Resulting in yyy total articles.

Further, if we restrict the data to the set where the originating data had non-null title and abstract 
matches, we see the following match rates:

xxx

In future work, we will resume exploration of more computationally intensive string similarity matching
that would allow for "fuzzier" matches. Our current strategy, if nothing else, has the virtue of being
relatively unambiguous and cheap to run.

In the next section, we recap how to use the match tables.
