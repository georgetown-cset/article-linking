the possibilities of biological sociology the new scientific trend with respect to its possible benefit for the progress of the nation a priority issue in the inter war period the author presents the arguments of bulgarian philosophers sociologists psychologists psychiatrists and other thinkers in the field of the humanities who commented on the achievements of biology and medicine and their applications for improving man and making social life healthier by means of various kinds of negative eugenics the article focuses on the theoretical controversy between the two approaches to society their serious consequences are commented on primarily in the context of this debate the discussion is also viewed as echoing european trends at that time regarding this new role of biology two philosophical schools in bulgaria rehmkeanism and marxism supported autonomous sociology according to which human society is radically different from the sphere of nature and the biological factor is not important for changing society the opponents of this view more numerous maintained that heredity was more important than the influence of social environment and upbringing hence eugenics the

issue in the inter war period the author presents the arguments of bulgarian philosophers sociologists psychologists psychiatrists and other thinkers in the field of the humanities who commented on the achievements of biology and medicine and their applications for improving man and making social life healthier by means of various kinds of negative eugenics the article focuses on the theoretical controversy between the two approaches to society their serious consequences are commented on primarily in the context of this debate the discussion is also viewed as echoing european trends at that time regarding this new role of biology two philosophical schools in bulgaria rehmkeanism and marxism supported autonomous sociology according to which human society is radically different from the sphere of nature and the biological factor is not important for changing society the opponents of this view more numerous maintained that heredity was more important than the influence of social

type diabetes group there were multigravid women and primigravid women there were women on insulin there were lower segment caesarean section and spontaneous vaginal delivery in fetal and neonatal complications there were three still births one case of intrapartum death and one case of shoulder dystocia fetal anomalies were less frequent one case of gastroschisis with hydrocephalus associated with menigomyelocoele there was one case of isolated hydrocephalus and there was also one case of truncus arteriosus conclusions the study analyses maternal and fetal complication in the gdm group and also preexisting diabetes group in our centre the women were gdm while were having pre existing diabetes total rate of fetal neonatal complication rate was and of congenital anomaly rate it was proportion of still birth intrauterine death and congenital malformations was higher in the pre existing diabetes group although the data are not large enough to draw a statistically significant conclusion lscs rate was little higher in the gdm group in comparison to the preexisting diabetes group where it was svd spontaneous vaginal delivery rate was in gdm and in the pre existing diabetes group hbac was within normal range of gdm group while in it was raised in the pre existing diabetes group only of women had hbac within acceptable range and had it the aim of st vincent declaration is to achieve pregnancy outcome in the diabetic woman that is similar to that of the non diabetic woman but so far we have not been able to achieve this our hbac level is remarkably high in the pre existing diabetes group only out of patients women took folic acid periconceptionally we need to work to achieve it our best it is well known that insulin treatment during pregnancy results in reduction in the rate of macrosomia fetal neonatal and maternal complications therefore we need to use insulin judiciously and advocate its usage in the situations where it is needed,"['pandey',

among others the paper describes the experimental and theoretical research for checking the transferability of the results gained until now onto large size reinforced concrete slabs with span widths of m and thicknesses of m through the use of high performance textile reinforcements based on carbon heavy tow yarns very high reinforcement degrees were realized the results show significant increases of the load carrying capacity compared to the unstrengthened reference slabs thus the safe use of bending strengthening out of trc for components with large span widths and high reinforcement degrees could be proven at the same time we were able to demonstrate considerably lower deflection with growing reinforcement degrees the experimentally determined load bearing capacity

von berechnungsmodellen mit denen unter anderem die maximale biegetragfahigkeit der verstarkten bauteile vorhergesagt werden kann der vorliegende aufsatz beschreibt experimentelle und theoretische untersuchungen zur uberprufung der ubertragbarkeit der bisher gewonnenen ergebnisse auf groÃformatige stahlbetonplatten mit spannweiten von m und plattendicken von m durch die verwendung textiler hochleistungsbewehrungen aus carbon auf basis von so genannten heavy tow garnen wurden sehr hohe verstarkungsgrade realisiert die ergebnisse zeigen signifikante steigerungen der tragfahigkeiten im vergleich zu unverstarkten referenzplatten dadurch konnte die sichere anwendung von biegeverstarkungen aus textilbeton auch fur bauteile mit groÃen spannweiten und groÃen verstarkungsgraden gezeigt werden gleichzeitig wurde bei vergleichbarem lastniveau mit zunehmendem verstarkungsgrad eine deutliche verringerung der durchbiegungen nachgewiesen die experimentell ermittelten tragfahigkeiten sind mit dem vorgestellten berehnungsansatz zur uberschlaglichen biegebemessung textilbetonverstarkter stahlbetonplatten gut nachvollziehbar bending capacity of reinforced concrete slabs strengthened with textile reinforced concrete textile reinforced concrete trc is a very effective method to strengthen reinforced concrete constructions the sfb of the tu dresden has been carrying out vast research concerning the use of trc for a subsequent bending strengthening of existing concrete and reinforced concrete components as a rule the experiments trc strengthened small format reinforced concrete slabs with span widths of m and thicknesses of m were used parallel to these tests calculation models were developed enabling a prediction of the maximum bending load carrying capacity of the strengthened units among others the paper describes the experimental and theoretical research for checking the transferability of the results gained until now onto large size reinforced concrete slabs with span widths of m and thicknesses of m through the use of high performance textile reinforcements based on carbon heavy tow yarns very high reinforcement degrees were realized the results show significant increases of the load carrying capacity compared to the unstrengthened reference slabs thus the safe use of bending strengthening out of trc for components with large span widths and high reinforcement degrees could be proven at the same time we were able to demonstrate considerably lower deflection with growing reinforcement degrees the experimentally determined load bearing capacity can be well comprehended with the introduced calculation models of the bending measurement of trc strengthened reinforced concrete slabs,"['schladitz', 'lorenz', 'curbach']"
