their serious consequences are commented on primarily in the context of this debate the discussion is also viewed as echoing european trends at that time regarding this new role of biology two philosophical schools in bulgaria rehmkeanism and marxism supported autonomous sociology according to which human society is radically different from the sphere of nature and the biological factor is not important for changing society the opponents of this view more numerous maintained that heredity was more important than the influence of social environment and upbringing hence eugenics the

of the national body a theoretical debate in bulgarian society in the inter war period this text discusses the debate pro and contra the possibilities of biological sociology the new scientific trend with respect to its possible benefit for the progress of the nation a priority issue in the inter war period the author presents the arguments of bulgarian philosophers sociologists psychologists psychiatrists and other thinkers in the field of the humanities who commented on the achievements of biology and medicine and their applications for improving man and making social life healthier by means of various kinds of negative eugenics the article focuses on the theoretical controversy between the two approaches to society their serious consequences are commented on primarily in the context of this debate the discussion is also viewed as echoing european trends at that time regarding this new role of biology two philosophical schools in bulgaria rehmkeanism and marxism supported autonomous sociology according to which human society is radically different from the sphere of nature and the biological factor is not important for changing society the opponents of this view more numerous maintained that heredity was more important than the influence of social environment and upbringing hence eugenics the science of the genetics based improvement of people and mankind held many possibilities the article presents the variety of stances that appeared after the change of the intellectual paradigm of biologizing social sciences as well as the actual attitudes underlying these stances the author looks for traces of this debate coming down to the present day biologia vs socjologia i postep ciała narodowego pewna teoretyczna debata w społeczenstwie bułgarskim w okresie

complications there were three still births one case of intrapartum death and one case of shoulder dystocia fetal anomalies were less frequent one case of gastroschisis with hydrocephalus associated with menigomyelocoele there was one case of isolated hydrocephalus and there was also one case of truncus arteriosus conclusions the study analyses maternal and fetal complication in the gdm group and also preexisting diabetes group in our centre the women were gdm while were having pre existing diabetes total rate of fetal neonatal complication rate was and of congenital anomaly rate it was proportion of still birth intrauterine death and congenital malformations was higher in the pre existing diabetes group although the data are not large enough to draw a statistically significant conclusion lscs rate was little higher in the gdm group in comparison to the preexisting diabetes group where it was svd spontaneous vaginal delivery rate was in gdm and in the pre existing diabetes group hbac was within normal range of gdm group while in it was raised in the pre existing diabetes group only of women had hbac within acceptable range and had it the aim of st vincent declaration is to achieve pregnancy outcome in the diabetic woman that is similar to that of the non diabetic woman but so far we have not been able to achieve this our hbac level is remarkably high in the pre existing diabetes group only out of patients women took folic acid periconceptionally we need to work to achieve it our best it is well known that insulin treatment during pregnancy results in reduction in the rate of macrosomia fetal neonatal and maternal complications therefore we need to use insulin judiciously and advocate its usage in the situations where it is needed,"['pandey',

that is the stochastic velocity type apos s langevin equation in n dimensional phase space or its equivalent liouville diffusion equation this equation is time reversed asymmetrical it shows that the form of motion of particles in statistical thermodynamic systems has the drift diffusion duality and the law of motion of statistical thermodynamics is expressed by a superposition of both the law of dynamics and the stochastic velocity and possesses both determinism and probability hence it is different from the law of motion of particles in dynamical systems the stochastic diffusion motion of
