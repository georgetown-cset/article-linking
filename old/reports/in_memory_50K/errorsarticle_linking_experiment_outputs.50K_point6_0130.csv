miss,WOS:000173705800007,2001,a novel interleukin il antagonist that blocks the biological activity of human il in immune and nonimmune cells,the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin il plays a major role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases including allergic rhinitis atopic dermatitis allergic asthma and malignancies therefore specific inhibitors of il may have important clinical applications we have previously produced a super agonist of il termed il rd by single amino acid substitution changing arg to asp at position in an effort to create a cell selective il agonist we performed a second mutation in the il rd molecule substituting lys for glu at position unexpectedly rather than an agonist this novel double mutein il dm termed il ekrd turned out to be an il antagonist it competes for i il binding sites as effectively as wtil designation of il ekrd as an il antagonist is supported further by a second assay involving a fusion protein consisting of the bacterial cytotoxic molecule peqqr as well as wtil il peqqr or il cytotoxin il ekrd neutralizes the cytotoxic activity of il cytotoxin exhibited in u and pm rcc cancer cell lines in addition il ekrd inhibits the proliferative activity of wtil in tf and l hematopoietic cell lines neutralizes wtil induced inhibition of cd expression on primary monocytes and prevents wtil induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription stat protein in ksy and thp cell lines thus il ekrd may be a useful agent for the study of interaction between il and its cognate receptors and may contribute to the development of new treatments for inflammatory diseases even malignancies in which il plays a central role,"['oshima', 'puri']",pub.1032955072,2001,a novel interleukin il antagonist that blocks the biological activity of human il in immune and nonimmune cells,the aim of this study was to develop novel agonists or antagonists of human interleukin il based on the homology of il between species and the homology between the il family of lymphokines and the known dimensional structure of four helical bundle cytokines we hypothesized and tested whether arginine r at position and glutamic acid e at position of human il molecule might be hot residues with significant biological importance in the ligand receptor interaction in various cell types recombinant wild type il wtil il rd in which r at position was substituted to aspartic acid d and il dm il ekrd in which e at position was substituted to lysine k and r to d at position were expressed in escherichia coli and purified from inclusion bodies visual inspection of bands suggested purity of all proteins to be more than binding studies were performed on the pm rcc renal carcinoma cell line and u glioblastoma cell line both express the type i il receptor il r as expected wtil displaced specific binding of radiolabeled il i il in both cell lines il dm also inhibited binding of i il binding affinity of il dm was similar to wtil fig to support the findings that il dm binds to il r at physiological temperatures we tested whether il ekrd can block the cytotoxicity mediated by il peqqr since il peqqr mediates cytotoxicity through binding to il r its cytotoxicity is correlated with the receptor interaction as expected il peqqr mediated cytotoxicity in a concentration dependent manner consistent with their ability to compete for i il binding il il rd or il dm blocked this cytotoxicity in a concentration dependent manner in both cell lines studied we measured the proliferative responses of wtil il rd and il dm alone or in combination with wtil and il ekrd in a tf cell line that expresses type iii il r as expected il and il rd stimulated the growth of tf cells in a concentration dependent manner in contrast il ekrd showed no proliferative activity fig a to determine the effect of il ekrd on il induced proliferation of tf and l hematopoietic cell lines we cultured cells in the presence of il ekrd and wtil under various conditions il dm significantly blocked the mitogenic activity of wtil in a concentration dependent manner fig b c d since il has been shown to down regulate cd expression on monocytes we investigated whether il dm can nullify the down regulating activity induced by wtil wtil suppressed cd expression although modestly on monocytes and il ekrd neutralized the effect of wtil stat activation is an early cellular response induced by il and is responsible for the biological effect mediated by il we therefore tested whether il dm can generate signaling through the stat pathway tory epstein barr virus immortalized b cells and thp monocytic cells that express type ii iii il r and ksy aids associated kaposi s sarcoma cells that express type i il r were used for this purpose in all cell types tested both wtil and il rd induced stat activation in a concentration dependent manner in sharp contrast il ekrd did not stimulate stat activation even at a high concentration in addition il dm blocked wtil induced stat activation in thp and ksy cell lines in a concentration dependent manner in this report we describe the production and characterization of an antagonist of il that was produced by site directed mutagenesis of two amino acids in the predicted α helix a and d of il molecule to be an effective antagonist the agent must be able to reverse or reduce the effect of an agonist and to bind and block cell receptors that normally bind naturally occurring ligand therefore we determined whether il mutein il ekrd mediated these activities we report that il dm inhibited wtil induced proliferation of tf and l cells reversed the wtil induced down modulation of cd expression and inhibited activation of stat induced by wtil the binding activity of il dm to il r was confirmed byi il binding and neutralization of cytotoxicity mediated by il peqqr in cancer cells thus the antagonistic activities of il ekrd were evident in cells that expressed type i and type ii iii il r fig previously we had produced a mutation in il molecule by a single amino acid substitution in α helix d of il molecule il rd because the position of amino acid in il was predicted to be localized in the corresponding amino acid at position in the il molecule and the mutation in this amino acid resulted into an il antagonist il yd it was predicted that il rd would be an il antagonist however the reverse was observed il rd turned out to be a powerful il agonist with to fold improved binding affinity to il receptors we have also produced a mutation at position of il which is predicted to be located in α helix a of il molecule in this il mutein e at position was changed to k this mutant protein il ek reported a fold higher binding affinity to il receptors than wtil on u cell lines to further improve the binding affinity of il we decided to produce a il dm combining the features of two previously produced mutations it was predicted that this molecule would have a much higher binding affinity to il receptor vs wtil this molecule was expressed in e coli and homogeneously purified material was found to bind il r however we did not observe a dramatic increase in binding affinity when tested in various biological assays this il dm turned out to be an antagonist of il the mechanisms underlying the antagonistic action of il ekrd are not known it is possible that a double mutation in il molecule causes inappropriate aggregation of receptor subunits resulting in defective coupling of intracellular messenger molecules alternatively these mutations may have created a novel conformation of il that binds il r but alters conformation which is incapable with signaling these possibilities are subject of our ongoing studies since il has been shown to be involved in many inflammatory diseases including bronchial asthma allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis it is expected that il ekrd will be able to neutralize the effect of il eventually ameliorating the disease phenotype finally since il is an autocrine growth factor for hodgkin reed sternberg tumor cells il dm may be useful in the therapy of hodgkin s disease future studies will

miss,WOS:000449830300011,2018,on the question of identity in a post apartheid world co creation as an alternative to ontorace logy,how does one understand who one is in a post apartheid world put differently what comes after the logic of apartheid in this article i take up the question by arguing for a notion of identity as action rather than essence that is a notion of identity that allows for one s existence in the world as always with others in order to argue the case the first part of the article hermeneutically analyses the logic that constitutes the colonial and apartheid conceptions of identity as onto race logy that is a logic taken over from a certain form of western metaphysical thinking that takes race as its highest and grounding principle according to which the totality is ordered according to this logic identity functions as something which is the same as itself a a it is an essentialised form of identity that is separate from the world as totality in a vacuum like existence the world and the other are therefore understood according to the categories of the self in which the self or its identity is given an elevated position in relation to the world and others that is a certain racial identity in the case of onto race logy furthermore the logic has two ethical implications firstly binary oppositions are set up the identity of the other becoming the negative pole of the positive self identity for instance the colonised african subject is seen as negative and primitive in relation to the western subject in apartheid terms the black man is regarded as godless and the opposite of the christian white man and branded as a kaffir the latter term originates from the arabic word kafir meaning infidel and may be compared to the use of negro in america and negre in the french speaking world both fulfilling the same function difference or strangeness is typified negatively and should therefore be kept apart in addition this negative typification occurs through the process of scapegoating which has a long history in the western world in which all the sins aggression guilt and violence of the group are projected onto the stranger this is a means of creating a binding identity and solidarity within a group moreover the negative typification and scapegoating is accompanied by the creation of myths that are not based in reality but in fantasy in this instance myths about the black man who is seen as exotic barbaric hyper sexual pre political and so forth these myths create a mask of race that covers the face of the other and provides the content with which to typify the second ethical implication is that the other is not only typified as negative but is also regarded as less valuable ontologically hence enclosed in the term kaffir is the misrecognition of the human dignity of the person enclosed by this concept of identity the same logic that holds for the relation between the self and the other is also at play in society and determines the way in which the totality and the relation between groups are structured the meaning within a society is determined by the identity of one group which may lead to a state of totalitarianism apartheid is an example of this function where the world we live in is determined by the categories of race which largely dominate to this day our identity is thus enclosed in and reduced to race the first part ends with an exploration of another reason for the creation and perpetuation of racial identities in the colonial and apartheid eras this reason concerns the creation of racial categories for the justification of the exploitation of people for capitalistic ends in other words if the black man is not regarded as fully human there can be no objection to treating them as inferior and to rationalise any practices that follow from such a conception since all identities are enclosed in this logic the white man is in turn regarded as fully human and therefore economic and political prosperity is justified and because this logic has not yet been overcome white privilege has become part of the everyday discourse in south africa a discourse in which the connection between economic prosperity and the identity of the white man is regarded as negative in the absence of political power more important although these constructions of white man and black man or any other racial construction might not apply to one one is still captured in them and the misrecognition of one s existence in the world may lead to alternative self conceptions the second part of the article explores what might follow on the logic of apartheid or the colony in the larger context namely the onto race logical constructions of identity two choices are outlined the first choice entails a perpetuation of the logic by a nostalgic appeal to the colonial and apartheid conception of identity or by the construction of a new absolute reference point as found in variations of the ideology of pan africanism and afrocentrism this would lead to the totality becoming enclosed in a logic based on an essentialised notion of identity the existence of the other in both cases being misrecognised apartheid itself may be regarded as an example of this choice because it originated in a project of decolonising british colonial oppression and reappropriated the problematic logic in new forms the second choice by contrast aims at breaking with that logic by reconsidering the notion of identity at an ontological level instead of an essentialised notion of identity identity should be considered as accounting for our existence in the world with others hence one does not think about the relation to the other or about self understanding from a point of isolation but rather in relation to the other in our co existence therefore where each person is co original co creation of meaning takes place the implication of this ontological shift is that there is no notion of a pure identity but rather that identities are always intertwined with other identities and that each identity needs an other to be an identity meaning is co created in tension with others moreover as part of our shared existence there is an ethical responsibility in our shared striving for a dignified life and that is the demand of the reparation of the human dignity of all thus to take responsibility for the past and the present is to contemplate our shared existence in the future and to take up the shared responsibility for it which makes it a universal task,['gerber'],pub.1109909258,2018,on the question of
